        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a driven and hard working individual. I have always
                had an interest in web development and have decided now
                is a good time to make a career change into the web    
                development industry, improving my future prospects. I am 
                currently a language teacher in public schools in japan which
                allows for the transfer of many key skills for in web 
                development such as an ability to understand syntax and how
                to consistently improve my skills through new skill aquisition
                methods.
