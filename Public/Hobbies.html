                    <p>I like to travel in my free time and experience cultures different to
                        what i have experienced before. I have visited over ten countries and 
                        nine prefectures in Japan.</p>

            <h2>Hiking</h2>

                <img src="../Assets/Akiha.PNG" height="350" width="350">
                    <p>I try to hike often as a form of light exercise and an opportunity to
                        see what you would not normally get the opportunity to see. Hiking is
                        a great opportunity to get out in nature and see what the world has to 
                        offer.</p>

                    <p>I play games to relax at the end of the day. Its a nice opportunity to 
                        catch up with friends after work and become a part of a larger overall 
                        community. I am a member of the Nintendo Basingstoke group back in my
                        hometown in the UK.</p>
